PROJECT: Logistics & Supply Chain Efficiency Analysis1. 

OBJECTIVE Analyzed over 90,000 completed orders to evaluate distribution center performance, identify shipping bottlenecks, and establish a benchmark for the average "Order-to-Door" lead time.

2. SQL DEVELOPMENT & LOGIC PROGRESSION

Code #1: Initial Direct JOIN

Purpose: To quickly calculate the Average Lead Time by connecting order_items directly to distribution_centers.

The Logic: Used inventory_item_id as the primary key to find which warehouse shipped which order.

Outcome: Successfully calculated a company-wide average of 2.66 days, but resulted in "null" values for Warehouse Names in Looker Studio due to inconsistent ID mapping in the raw dataset.

Code #2: The "Bridge" Query (Final Solution)
Purpose: To resolve the "null" data gap and successfully map performance metrics to specific geographic locations.
The Logic: Engineered a multi-table JOIN using the products table as a "bridge" (Order Items -> Products -> Distribution Centers).
Why I Switched: The initial link was inconsistent; by switching to a Product-to-Warehouse mapping, I ensured 100% data integrity, allowing names like Chicago IL and Memphis TN to appear in the final report.

3. KEY INSIGHTS
Performance Benchmark: Established an average total lead time of 2.66 days.
Volume Leader: Identified Chicago IL as the highest volume processing center.
Geographic Bottlenecks: Pinpointed warehouses with higher-than-average lead times to prioritize operational improvements.
