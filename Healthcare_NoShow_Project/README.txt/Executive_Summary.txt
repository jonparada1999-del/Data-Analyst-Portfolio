Executive Summary: Patient No-Show Analytics
1. Project Objective Analyzed a dataset of 110,000+ medical records to identify the primary drivers behind a 20% patient no-show rate and provide data-driven recommendations for clinic optimization.

2. Technical Stack

Storage/Analysis: Google BigQuery (SQL)

Visualization: Looker Studio

Data Management: Cloud-native migration (moving from MySQL to BigQuery to resolve local environment limitations).

3. Key Findings

Neighborhood Hotspots: Identified 10 neighborhoods with no-show rates exceeding 23%, specifically Santos Dumont at 28.9%.

Wait Time Impact: Patients with wait times over 30 days were significantly more likely to miss appointments compared to same-day bookings.

SMS Effectiveness: Patients who received SMS reminders had a 16.7% no-show rate, compared to 24.9% for those who did not, proving that text alerts significantly improve attendance.

4. Recommendations Targeted outreach and transportation support should be prioritized for patients in high-risk neighborhoods like Santos Dumont, especially for those with appointment lead times exceeding two weeks.
