# Corporate Tax Provision & Risk Engine (2026)

## Executive Summary
I developed an automated tax engine to bridge the gap between **Net Book Income** and **Taxable Income**. This project demonstrates my ability to apply complex 2026 tax logic to large-scale corporate datasets.

## Key Features
* **Automated Add-Backs:** SQL logic to identify non-deductible expenses (Fines, 50% Meals).
* **Liability Calculation:** Automated federal (21%) and state (2.5%) tax forecasting.
* **Audit Risk Scoring:** Identified high-risk entities based on historical penalty data.

## Business Impact
* **Scale:** Processed records for 2,000+ companies (Scalable to 100k+).
* **Accuracy:** Eliminated manual entry errors in quarterly estimated tax payments.
* **Compliance:** Integrated 2026 "OBBBA" tax law changes into the automated workflow.
